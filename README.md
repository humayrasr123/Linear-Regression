📘 Linear Regression: Student Score Prediction
This project uses a Simple Linear Regression model to predict a student's score based on the number of hours studied. It is a basic example of supervised machine learning applied to educational performance data.

📊 Objective
To implement and evaluate a linear regression model that can predict the expected score of a student given the number of hours they studied.

🧰 Tools & Libraries Used
Python 3

Jupyter Notebook

pandas – for data handling

numpy – for numerical operations

matplotlib & seaborn – for visualization

sklearn – for training and evaluating the regression model

📁 Files
LinearRegression_Model.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing all steps of the analysis, model building, training, and evaluation.

🚀 How It Works
Data Loading: Import a dataset containing study hours and corresponding student scores.

Data Visualization: Explore the relationship using scatter plots and regression lines.

Model Training: Fit a simple linear regression model using Scikit-learn.

Prediction: Predict scores based on test data.

Evaluation: Assess model accuracy using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R² score.

📈 Example Output
Predicted Score for a student studying 9.25 hours/day: 93.69

🧪 Evaluation Metrics
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

R² Score

Visual comparison between predicted and actual scores

📌 Conclusion
This project demonstrates how linear regression can be used for basic predictive modeling tasks. The strong linear relationship between hours studied and scores shows that even simple models can provide meaningful insights when data is clean and well-correlated.
